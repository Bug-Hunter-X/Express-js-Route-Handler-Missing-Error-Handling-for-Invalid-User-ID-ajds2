## Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling for invalid input.  Specifically, the `/users/:id` route fails to handle cases where the `id` parameter is not a valid number. This can result in unexpected behavior, crashes, or vulnerabilities.

The `bug.js` file showcases the flawed code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling.
